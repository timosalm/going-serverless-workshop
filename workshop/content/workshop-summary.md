The goal of this interactive workshop was to teach you how to implement your serverless applications and compile them to GraalVM native images for almost instant startup times and reduced memory consumption with Spring Boot 3.

Many thanks to my great former colleague **Dan Dobrin** for creating the foundation for this interactive workshop!
