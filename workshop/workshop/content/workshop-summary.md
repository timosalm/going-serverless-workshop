Spring Native is currently **available in public beta** with new releases coming in the next few month. 
The goal is to have **first-class support** for native application deployment, as well as an **optimized footprint on the JVM** with **Spring Boot 3**, based on Spring Framework 6, which is planned to be **GA at the end of this year**.

Many thanks to my great former colleague **Dan Dobrin** for creating the foundation for this interactive workshop!
