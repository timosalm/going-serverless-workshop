We'll now see how we can provide the configuration to the native-image tool that is needed for the undetected usages of dynamic language features with Spring Boot.

The `RuntimeHints API` collects the need for reflection, resource loading, serialization, and JDK proxies at runtime. 
Several contracts are handled automatically during AOT processing. For cases that the **core container cannot infer**, you can **register such hints programmatically** by implementing the `RuntimeHintsRegistrar` interface. Implementations of this interface can be registered using `@ImportRuntimeHints` on any Spring bean or @Bean factory method.

If you have **classes that need binding** (mostly needed when serializing or deserializing JSON), most of the hints are automatically inferred, for example when accepting or returning data from a @RestController method. But when you work with WebClient or RestTemplate directly, you might need to use `@RegisterReflectionForBinding` annotation.

##### Reflection
To bypass the class loading and reflection problems, we can add the hints in the following way.
```editor:open-file
file: samples/spring-native-reflection/src/main/java/com/example/springnativereflection/Reflection.java
line: 26
```
If at all possible, `@ImportRuntimeHints` should be used as close as possible to the component that requires the hints. This way, if the component is not contributed to the BeanFactory, the hints wonâ€™t be contributed either.

Before creating a native image, let's run the AOT compilation and observe that correct configurations have been generated.
```terminal:execute
command: |
  cd samples/spring-native-reflection
  ./mvnw clean package -Pnative -DskipTests
  cat target/spring-aot/main/resources/META-INF/native-image/com.example/spring-native-reflection/reflect-config.json | grep 'StringReverser\|StringCapitalizer' -A 8 -B 1
  cd $HOME
clear: true
```

As this is the case, let's create the native image and run the application.
```terminal:execute
command: |
  cd samples/spring-native-reflection
  ./mvnw -Pnative -DskipTests native:compile 
  ./target/spring-native-reflection com.example.springnativereflection.StringReverser reverse "what is new"
  ./target/spring-native-reflection com.example.springnativereflection.StringCapitalizer capitalize "what is new"
  cd $HOME
clear: true
```

#### Accessing Resources
Resources that should be available on the classpath to be accessible at runtime can be specified in the same way.
```editor:open-file
file: samples/spring-native-accessing-resources/src/main/java/com/example/springnativeaccessingresources/ResourceAccess.java
line: 1
```

You can run the Spring AOT plugin and observe that correct configurations have been generated, ...
```terminal:execute
command: |
  cd samples/spring-native-accessing-resources
  ./mvnw clean package -Pnative -DskipTests
  cat target/spring-aot/main/resources/META-INF/native-image/com.example/spring-native-accessing-resources/resource-config.json | grep hello
  cd $HOME
clear: true
```

... build the image and run the application.
```terminal:execute
command: |
  cd samples/spring-native-accessing-resources
  ./mvnw -Pnative -DskipTests native:compile 
  ./target/spring-native-accessing-resources
  cd $HOME
clear: true
```
#### Class Initialization
We can control the initialization with Spring Boot with the `@NativeHint` declaration.
```editor:open-file
file: samples/spring-native-class-initialization/src/main/java/com/example/springnativeclassinitialization/ClassInit.java
line: 1
```

You can run the Spring AOT plugin and observe that correct configurations have been generated ...
```terminal:execute
command: |
  cd samples/spring-native-class-initialization
  ./mvnw clean package -Pnative -DskipTests
  cat target/spring-aot/main/resources/META-INF/native-image/com.example/spring-native-class-initialization/native-image.properties
  cd $HOME
clear: true
```

... build the image and run the application.
```terminal:execute
command: |
  cd samples/spring-native-class-initialization
  ./mvnw -Pnative -DskipTests native:compile 
  ./target/spring-native-class-initialization
  cd $HOME
clear: true
```

#### Dynamic Proxy and Serialization
Hints for the Dynamic Proxy and Serialization features can be provided in the same way via `hints.proxies().registerJdkProxy(MyInterface.class)` and `hints.serialization().registerType(MySerializableClass.class)`.
